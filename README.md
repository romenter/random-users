# Package JS

In this project i used the principals utils of package for have a clean and optimized code.

I played with alias and used loaders for images; 

configurate dev a build mode; 

add some scripts in package.json (like watch and mode production);

create a .env  file, and for public view, env-example;

and many other functions in package js;

used webpackTools and BundleAnalyzer;

and many other functions i can't remember but you can see in the code.

I don't recomend you do it, because is only practice.
